## AWS
AWS was giving me trouble with the domain name, so I used namecheap.com to get a domain name instead and directed it to my AWS instance

## Caddy
Didn't have any issues here, except for figuring out the correct way to enter the dns entry into namecheap.com so I could have a url without a subdomain. Apparently I needed to put the @ symbol for "no subdomain"
